The instrument was filed on 24 June 2016 with the UN Secretary-General in his capacity as depository for the Convention.  The Amendment, adopted on 22 September 1995 by the third meeting of the Basel Convention Conference of Parties (COP3), would ban transboundary shipments of hazardous wastes for any reason, including recycling, from the member states of the European Community, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and Liechtenstein, to other Parties. The Amendment will enter into force on the 90th day after the receipt of the instrument of ratification, approval, formal confirmation or acceptance by at least three-fourths (66) of the 87 Parties at the time the Amendment was adopted in 1995. Since South Africa was a Party when the Amendment was adopted, its ratification means the Ban Amendment only needs seven more ratifications, approvals or acceptances in order to trigger entry into force.

The officials were gathered for the Sixth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD-VI) Summit, which focused on the theme, \\u2018Advancing Africa's Sustainable Development Agenda: TICAD Partnership for Prosperity.'  September 2016: Heads of State and Government and representatives of Japan and 54 African countries have adopted the Nairobi Declaration, a three-year plan to promote structural economic transformation, resilient health care systems and social stability for shared prosperity. The officials were gathered for the Sixth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD-VI) Summit, which focused on the theme, \\u2018Advancing Africa\\u2019s Sustainable Development Agenda: TICAD Partnership for Prosperity.\\u2019  TICAD meets regularly to promote high-level policy dialogue among Japan, African leaders and development partners. Over 6,000 participants attended this year\\u2019s Summit, which took place in Nairobi, Kenya, from 27-28 August 2016, the first time a TICAD Summit has been held in Africa since TICAD\\u2019s inception in 1993. The Government of Kenya, the Government of Japan, the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the World Bank, the African Union Commission (AUC) and the UN Office of the Special Advisor on Africa (OSAA) organized the event. The Nairobi Declaration addresses opportunities for promoting economic diversification and industrialization through agriculture, innovation and an information and communications technology (ICT) economy. It stresses the importance of quality infrastructure, the private sector, and skills development in Africa\\u2019s structural economic transformation. On social stability for shared prosperity, the Declaration recommends promoting inclusive and sustainable livelihoods and managing shocks and vulnerabilities to foster shared prosperity, underpin social stability and address the root causes of radicalization. The Declaration stresses that addressing climate change, natural resource loss, desertification, wildlife poaching, illegal fishing, food, water and energy insecurity, and natural disasters is critical to achieve social stability in Africa. The Declaration also recommends developing and implementing affordable social protection mechanisms to improve poor households\\u2019 access to productive assets and reduce seasonal income fluctuations. On promoting resilient health systems, the Declaration calls for strengthening health systems, achieving universal health coverage (UHC), and prioritizing prevention and preparedness against pandemics, including by mobilizing financial resources from international organizations. The Declaration also: commits to international, continental and regional levels on various issues; includes collaboration on peacebuilding, cross-border security and prevention of violent extremism; and addresses implementation. The conference included the launch of UNDP\\u2019s \\u2018Africa Human Development Report (HDR),\\u2019 which focuses on gender equality and women\\u2019s empowerment in Africa. The report finds that gender inequality contributes to lower economic growth on the continent. UNDP Administrator Helen Clark, addressing the opening session, noted that \\u201cHarnessing the potential of Africa\\u2019s youth by investing in education, skills development and other social initiatives can reap enormous dividends and spur the continent\\u2019s development.\\u201d In advance of the Summit, Japan\\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) and other organizations organized a two-day event on the role of tackling deforestation and forest degradation and promoting sustainable forest management (SFM) and agroforestry in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Africa. Participants discussed the future of wood-based energy and the role of forest and landscape restoration for food security and resilience to climate change. The event also highlighted initiatives to promote integrated landscape management with climate change adaptation and mitigation and poverty alleviation and food security efforts, such as the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100).

Kishore Singh said the HLP report lacked an emphasis on accountability, which is \\u201cregrettable.\\u201d Singh said, \\u201cRights without remedies are not rights at all. The post-2015 development agenda must move beyond political commitments, and more closely reflect the obligations undertaken by States under international human rights law.\\u201d He called for governments to make their commitments \\u201cjusticiable in their national legal systems.\\u201d In the context of the right to education, Singh explained, \\u201cAs we embark on more complex challenges, we must ensure that the right-holders themselves, the students and their parents, have the ability to challenge governments to meet their international obligations.\\u201d He urged Member States to give the post-2015 development goals a firm framework for accountability, with appropriate indicators.
